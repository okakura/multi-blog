Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the folder structure and where different types of files are located (e.g., components, hooks, services).

2. **Data Flow**: Be aware of how data flows through the application, including the use of context, props, and state management.

3. **API Integration**: Follow the established patterns for API calls, including error handling and loading states. Utilize SWR for data fetching and caching where appropriate.

4. **Styling**: Adhere to the project's styling guidelines, including the use of tailwind or other styling solutions.

5. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass. Follow the testing strategy used in the project (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).

6. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality by following best practices, including code reviews, linting, and adhering to the project's coding standards.

7. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed to reflect changes in the codebase or project structure.

8. **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively with team members and seek feedback on changes. Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
